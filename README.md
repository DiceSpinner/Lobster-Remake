# Lobster-Remake
Remake of the game I wrote back in g11. (See https://github.com/DiceSpinner/lobster/tree/master/mike.yuan)

The goal of this project is to gain experience in building up programs of larger scale with application of materials learned in CSC148 at UofT (data structures, OOP inheritance, etc) as well as exploring new python features. The game will have the same features as its predecessor with some improvements/generalization as well some new mechanics. Currently I'm focusing on the design of the gameplay system and building up the frame of the game before filling in the content, so there won't be that much gameplay update in the near future, but I will try add more content throughout the process. 

Checkout Game_Structure.pdf for more info about how the game runs if you're interested. (Will be updated regularly)
